# ExpressMart-Sales-Analytics
## Project Overview
### **Introduction**
This report analyses transactional data from Express Mart, a growing e-commerce and retail business operating in major cities such as Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, New York City, and San Francisco. Although Express Mart has consistently achieved strong sales figures, management seeks to enhance overall business performance by understanding customer purchase behaviour, identifying sales trends, and optimising operational efficiency across its locations.

The dataset under review comprises 185,950 transaction records, capturing detailed information on product sales, quantity ordered, pricing, sales timing, and geographic distribution.

 **Objective**
The primary objective of this analysis is to:  
- Identify key products and customer purchasing patterns to maximise revenue.
- Highlight peak sales periods to better align operational staffing and marketing strategies.
- Detect potential inefficiencies such as order duplication or stock mismanagement.
- Provide strategic recommendations that will drive Express Mart's profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational excellence.
  
**Problem Statement**
While current sales metrics show healthy growth, Express Mart faces challenges related to:  

- Optimising staffing during peak hours to prevent missed sales opportunities.
- Targeting marketing campaigns effectively based on customer behaviour.
- Enhancing cross-selling tactics to boost average order value.
Maintaining clean and accurate sales data for financial reporting is crucial to the operational efficiency of the company, thus, a data-driven approach is required to refine operational strategies, increase conversion rates, and sustain long-term business growth.


**Key Trends Observed**  

- Product Sales Patterns: High-ticket items like the MacBook Pro Laptop dominate individual sale values, while lower-cost accessories such as USB-C Charging Cables can also generate high volume sales.
- Location Performance: Sales are concentrated in key cities such as New York City, San Francisco, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Dallas.
- Time-Based Trends: Sales activity peaks during midday to evening hours (typically 11 AM to 7 PM), indicating optimal windows for operational and marketing focus.
- Holiday Effect: There is a noticeable increase in sales volume during the holiday season (November–December), consistent with broader retail industry trends.

 **Insights**  
 
*Sales by Month*
- Sales consistently peak during the holiday months, particularly in November and December.
- Lower sales volumes are observed in February and March, indicating seasonal dips after the holiday rush. <br>
A well-timed marketing campaign launched in early November could maximise holiday season sales even further.

**Sales by City Top-performing cities include**  

- San Francisco led by \ 8,262,203.91 in sales
- New York City had \ 5,452,570.80 in sales
- Los Angeles followed by \ 4,664,317.43 in sales
- Poland and Austin had lower sales, around \2,320,490.61 and \1,819,581.75, indicating different customer base and regional preferences. Cities like Seattle and Atlanta show strong potential for growth, but currently underperform relative to their population size.
As such, there is a need to intensify local marketing and promotions in Atlanta and Seattle could tap into unmet market demand.

**Top 5 Products by Sales**  

MacBook Pro Laptop had the highest sales value of \8037600.00, followed by iPhone and Thinkpad with \4,794,300.00 and **\4,129,958.70 respectivey.

**Sales by Quarter**

- Quarter 4 (October - December) shows the highest overall sales of about \11,549,773.42, driven largely by holiday shopping.
- Quarter 1 (January - March) reflects the lowest performance, indicating a post-holiday slowdown.
- Sales dipped in September to \2,097,560.13, indicating that it was one of the slowest sales months.
  
**Quantity Ordered by Hour**  

- The majority of purchases occur between 11 AM and 7 PM, with peaks around 12 PM (lunchtime) and late afternoon (5 PM - 6 PM).
- Early mornings (before 9 AM) and late nights (after 9 PM) show significantly fewer transactions.
  

## Recommendations  

1.  Increase Staffing During Peak Hours (11 AM and 7 PM) by 30%–40% during these hours, as shorter wait times and more sales support can convert more browsers into buyers.
  
2. Organise Promotional Campaigns Type (a):  

- Limited-time discounts, flash sales (e.g., "20% off from 5 PM to 8 PM") to create urgency.
- Organise Bundle Promotions, e.g, buy one premium product and get 20% off an accessory.
- Organise Holiday Campaigns that target big seasons like Black Friday, Christmas, Back-to-School, and New Year Sales.
  
***Type(b):***  

- Email Marketing (target previous buyers with related products.
- Social Media Ads (Instagram, Facebook) with time-limited offers.
  
3. Pair High-Demand, Low-Cost Accessories with Big-Ticket Items. e.g. MacBook Pro Laptop → USB-C Charging Cable or 27in FHD Monitor,iPhone Products → Wired Headphones and Apple AirPods

4. Geographical Expansion Strategy.
    
- Increase regional advertising spending by 20%–30% in (New York City,San Francisco, Atlanta) high-performing cities.
- For underperforming regions, launch city-specific promotions to boost brand visibility.
  
5. Increase stock for high-volume, fast-selling products like USB-C Charging Cables, Wired Headphones, and 27-inch Monitors.
6. Monitor low-selling SKUS and reduce overstock risks by discounting slow-moving items.
